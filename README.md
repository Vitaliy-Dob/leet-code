# 461. Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees
Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
# 136. Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 226. Invert Binary Tree
Invert a binary tree.
# 283. Move Zeroes
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
# 538. Convert BST to Greater Tree
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
# 206. Reverse Linked List
Reverse a singly linked list.
# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
# 100. Same Tree
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# 70. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
# 101. Symmetric Tree
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
